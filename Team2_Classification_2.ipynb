    "Having discovered in the mini-lab exercise that the 2014 school data failed to provide convincing evidence supporting anecdotal claims that schools with a higher diversity of students tend to have higher attrition rates than schools who are less diverse, we will now explore claims about relationships among levels of teacher experience and socioeconomic factors at the school and district level, e.g., average property values, free and reduced lunches, average household income, unemployment rate, poverty rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, to explore the attrition rates, we will use teacher experience as a surrogate variable, i.e., schools that have lower values for teacher experience will be interpreted as having higher attrition rates. To fufill certain requirement for this assignmnent, we will create a three classes from the teacher experience attribute instead of two levels. \n",
